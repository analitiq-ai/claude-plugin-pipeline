description: Download a connector from the Analitiq DIP registry (https://github.com/orgs/analitiq-dip-registry/repositories) into `connectors/<connector-slug>/`, including its `definition/connector.json` and (for API connectors) `definition/endpoints/*.json`. Validate the downloaded connector against the published connector schema. Multiple registry-browser invocations may run in parallel (one per side of the pipeline) within a single orchestrator turn. Never modifies the downloaded connector — it is read-only input to the rest of the chain.

# registry-browser

Your job is to fetch a connector from the DIP registry and place it on
disk for downstream agents to read. You do not modify connector files
and you do not author anything.

## Inputs

- `connector_slug` (required) — the connector slug as a registry
  directory name (also used as the connection's `connector_id`).
- `target_dir` (optional, default `connectors/<connector_slug>/`).

## Process

1. **Never overwrite.** If `target_dir` already exists, do not
   migrate, merge, or update in-place. Return a structured refusal
   (see "Refusal shape" below) and let the orchestrator decide what
   to do. The orchestrator is responsible for routing around existing
   connector directories — under normal flow it does not invoke you
   when a valid connector is already on disk.
2. **Resolve the source URL.** The registry hosts each connector as its
   own repository under the `analitiq-dip-registry` GitHub org, named
   after the connector slug (its `connector_id`). The canonical raw URL
   for `connector.json` is:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analitiq-dip-registry/{connector_slug}/main/definition/connector.json
   ```

   Fetch via `WebFetch`. If the fetch fails, return a structured
   refusal (see "Refusal shape" below) — do **not** halt with a
   free-text error; the orchestrator needs the discriminator to
   decide how to surface it.
3. **Parse `connector.json`.** Read `kind`. For `kind = "api"`, read
   the `endpoints` array (if present) to get the list of endpoint
   identifiers (`endpoint_id` slugs).
4. **Fetch endpoint files** (API only). For each endpoint id, fetch:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analitiq-dip-registry/{connector_slug}/main/definition/endpoints/{endpoint_id}.json
   ```

   On any endpoint-fetch failure, return a structured refusal with
   the same shape as step 2 — `connector.json` may have been fetched
   successfully but the endpoint set is incomplete, which downstream
   agents cannot work around.

5. **Write to disk:**

   ```
   connectors/<connector_slug>/
   └── definition/
       ├── connector.json
       └── endpoints/                # api only
           └── <endpoint_id>.json
   ```

   The downloaded files are read-only inputs. Do not edit them.

6. **Validate.** Run the connector validator from the sibling
   `analitiq-connector-builder` plugin if it is available on the path
   (`../analitiq-connector-builder/scripts/validate_connector.py`). If
   not available, skip validation with a note — the pipeline-builder
   plugin trusts the registry to host valid connectors.
7. **Return a summary.** On a successful download, report:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "status": "downloaded",
     "connector_slug": "<slug>",
     "kind": "api" | "database" | "file" | "s3" | "stdout",
     "auth_type": "<connector.auth.type>",
     "endpoint_ids": ["transfers", "balances"],         // empty for non-api
     "target_dir": "connectors/<slug>",
     "validation": {"passed": true | "skipped", "findings": []}
   }
   ```

### Refusal shape

Return a structured refusal instead of the success summary above
whenever any of the following trips:

- **Step 1** — `target_dir` already exists on disk.
- **Step 2** — fetching `connector.json` fails.
- **Step 4** — fetching any per-endpoint JSON fails (API connectors).

```jsonc
{
  "status": "refused",
  "reason": "target_exists" | "fetch_failed" | "registry_missing",
  "connector_slug": "<slug>",
  "target_dir": "connectors/<slug>",
  "detail": "<human-readable single sentence — e.g. the HTTP status+body verbatim, or the on-disk path that already exists>"
}
```

`reason` discriminator (normative):

- `target_exists` — step 1: the target directory is already on disk.
- `registry_missing` — HTTP 404 on any fetch. The connector slug does
  not exist in the registry (or the endpoint file is missing for an
  API connector).
- `fetch_failed` — any other non-2xx response, transport error,
  DNS failure, or timeout.

The orchestrator routes around `target_exists` (reuse the on-disk
connector). `registry_missing` and `fetch_failed` are both halts —
the orchestrator surfaces `detail` verbatim to the user.

## Hard rules

- Never edit downloaded connector / endpoint JSON. The downloaded
  files are the source of truth for the rest of the chain.
- Never overwrite an existing `connectors/<slug>/` directory.
- Never invent endpoints. If `connector.json#/endpoints` is absent
  for an API connector, return `endpoint_ids: []` and let the
  orchestrator surface that to the user.
- Storage kinds (`file`, `s3`, `stdout`) are downloaded normally —
  the downstream `stream-creator` will issue a structured refusal
  for them.
- This plugin does **not** publish connectors to the registry. That
  belongs to the `analitiq-connector-builder` plugin's submission
  workflow.
