"""Render contract-owned facts from the published package into the prose docs.

The agent-facing prose under ``src/`` is the only prose Analitiq still keeps —
the schema contract itself is defined by the published ``analitiq-validator`` +
``analitiq-contract-models`` packages. Anything an agent needs that those
packages already state (enum members, regexes, required-field lists, bounds,
defaults, cross-field rule text) is therefore **generated** into the prose from
the installed package rather than retyped by hand, so a doc cannot drift from
the contract it documents.

Each generated region is delimited in the markdown by a marker pair::

    <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: <block-id> -->
    …emitted content…
    <!-- END GENERATED: <block-id> -->

Everything outside the markers is hand-written judgment (when to use a rule, how
to ask the user, what the plugin refuses to do) — this script never touches it.

Usage::

    python3 src/scripts/gen_contract_docs.py            # rewrite blocks in place
    python3 src/scripts/gen_contract_docs.py --check    # exit 1 if any block is stale

``--check`` is what CI runs: it regenerates into memory and diffs, so a pin bump
that changes the contract fails the build until the docs are regenerated.
