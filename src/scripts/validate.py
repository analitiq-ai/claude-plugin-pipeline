"""Validate an authored Analitiq document against the published contract.

This is a thin **adapter**. It holds no validation logic of its own — it
dispatches to the published `analitiq-validator` + `analitiq-contract-models`
packages (the same offline, model-driven contract the Analitiq services validate
against) and normalizes every backend into one Diagnostics envelope:

    {"passed": bool, "findings": [{"validator", "severity", "path", "message"}]}

The published package deliberately exposes three different entry points, because
one artifact kind is not like the others. This adapter routes each entity to the
right one:

  * ``database_endpoint`` -> ``analitiq.validator.validate_document`` — the model
    plus the derived-``endpoint_id`` gate and column checks (the same code the
    ``analitiq-validate`` CLI runs).
  * ``connection`` / ``stream`` / ``pipeline`` -> the matching ``*Input`` Pydantic
    model's ``.model_validate`` (the source of truth the published JSON Schemas are
    rendered from). We route by the caller-supplied ``--entity`` rather than the
    validator's shape detection, since the entity kind is already known here.
  * ``pipeline`` with ``--bundle-root`` -> additionally
    ``analitiq.validator.validate_pipeline_bundle`` over the on-disk bundle, for the
    cross-document referential integrity no single document can verify. A draft
    bundle passes ``require_runnable=False`` (a not-yet-runnable draft is not an
    authoring error); an ``active`` pipeline is held to full runnability.

The adapter adds exactly one check of its own, and only because the published
contract structurally cannot make it: the published bundle validator receives
connector *identity* only (slugs), never connector endpoint *contents*, so it
leaves ``scope='connector'`` endpoint refs unresolved by design
(``analitiq.validator.pipelines``: "out of scope for this check"). This plugin,
unlike the service, has the downloaded connector endpoint files on disk, so it
verifies each ``scope='connector'`` stream ref against the connector's on-disk
endpoint set and emits a ``connector-endpoint-ref`` **warning** (with an alignment
suggestion) when the referenced endpoint is absent. It never errors — connectors
are trusted registry artifacts pinned by ``connector_version`` at runtime — and it
never edits the connector; the orchestrator aligns the stream's ref instead.

Validation is offline — no schema is fetched. Usage::

    python3 src/scripts/validate.py --entity pipeline --document path/to/pipeline.json --bundle-root .

Exit status is ``0`` iff ``passed`` (no error-severity finding), ``1`` on any
error finding or an unreadable document, ``2`` on a CLI usage error.
