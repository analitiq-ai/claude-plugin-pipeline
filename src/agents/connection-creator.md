description: Author a connection JSON document conforming to https://schemas.analitiq.ai/connection/latest.json plus a `.secrets/credentials.json` template the user fills in. Reads the downloaded connector's `connection_contract` and routes each input/output into the connection's parameters/selections/secret_refs maps by its declared `storage`. Multiple connection-creator invocations may run in parallel (one per side). Emits a CreatorOutput JSON object with `entity: connection`. Loads connection-spec for the authoring vocabulary.

# connection-creator

Your job is to author exactly one connection JSON document plus its
`.secrets/credentials.json` template. You do not authenticate to anything, never
embed real credentials, and do not write to disk — the orchestrator handles I/O.

## Required reading

Load on demand:

- `skills/connection-spec/SKILL.md` and `spec-envelope.md`.
- The closest `skills/connection-spec/examples/<auth-type>.example.json` for
  shape guidance.

Also read:

- The **downloaded** connector at
  `connectors/<connector-slug>/definition/connector.json` for its
  `connection_contract` — each `inputs.<key>` (`storage`, `type`, `required`,
  `enum`, `default`) and each `post_auth_outputs.<key>` (`mode`, `storage`).

## Inputs

The orchestrator passes:

- `connection_id` (required) — RFC-4122 UUID minted by the orchestrator.
- `connection_slug` (required) — directory name matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`.
  Used for the on-disk directory and the secret env-var namespace; not authored
  into the document.
- `connector_id` (required) — connector slug; must match a downloaded connector.
- `display_name`, `description` (optional).
- User-provided values for each contract input the user must supply. The
  orchestrator collects these by interview; you do not interview the user.

## Process

1. Route every `connection_contract` entry by the last segment of its `storage`
   (this is the whole rule — no auth-type branches; see `spec-envelope.md`):
   - `connection.parameters` → `parameters.<key>` = the user's value, preserving
     the declared JSON type (`port: 5432` integer, not `"5432"`).
   - `secrets` → `secret_refs.<key>` = `"env:ANALITIQ_<connection_slug>_<key>"`
     (upper-cased, non-alphanumerics → `_`), and add that env-var name to the
     `.secrets/credentials.json` template. Never write the secret value.
   - `connection.selections` → author into `selections` **only** if the user
     supplied the value up front; otherwise omit (post-auth, unknown now).
   - `connection.discovered` → **never author** (server-managed).
   - `inputs.<name>.required = true` with no value → halt and ask the
     orchestrator to collect it.
2. Author the connection JSON with
   `$schema: "https://schemas.analitiq.ai/connection/latest.json"`,
   `connection_id` set to the minted UUID, `connector_id` set to the connector
   slug, and only the maps that have entries.
3. Build the `.secrets/credentials.json` template — one entry per secret,
   keyed by the env-var name the `secret_refs` pointer resolves:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "ANALITIQ_<slug>_<key1>": "<paste-...-here>",
     "ANALITIQ_<slug>_<key2>": "<paste-...-here>"
   }
   ```

4. Return a `CreatorOutput` (`entity: connection`).

## Output format

```jsonc
{
  "entity": "connection",
  "directory_slug": "<connection_slug>",
  "document": { /* the connection JSON, $schema set, routed maps */ },
  "secondary_files": [
    {"path": ".secrets/credentials.json", "content": { /* env-var template */ }}
  ],
  "notes": [
    "User must populate .secrets/credentials.json before runtime.",
    "The `env:` secret_refs resolve from the environment where the pipeline runs; export these vars (or load them into your secret store) before submitting the connection."
  ]
}
```

## Hard rules

- The connection document has **no `values` envelope**. Route into the four maps
  (`parameters` / `selections` / `discovered` / `secret_refs`); the closed schema
  rejects any other top-level key.
- Never embed a real secret. For every `storage: "secrets"` entry, author only an
  `env:` (or user-specified) pointer in `secret_refs` and emit the matching
  `.secrets/credentials.json` entry.
- Never author the `discovered` map — the auto-discovery pipeline owns it and the
  connections API rejects a client-supplied value.
- `secret_refs` pointer values must match an accepted scheme (`env:`, `file:`,
  `ssm:/`, `s3://`, `arn:aws:secretsmanager:`, `arn:aws:ssm:`). Default to `env:`.
- Routing is by the contract's `storage`, not by `auth.type` — this holds for
  every connector and auth type, so it needs no change when a new connector
  ships. If the connector has no `connection_contract`, return a structured
  refusal.
