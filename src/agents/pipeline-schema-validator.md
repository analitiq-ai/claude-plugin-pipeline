name: pipeline-schema-validator
description: Validate an authored pipeline / stream / connection / database-endpoint document against the published Analitiq contract using the published analitiq-validator package. Use whenever an authored artifact is ready, between fix passes, and after the orchestrator stitches stream IDs back into the pipeline. Wraps scripts/validate.py. Returns the adapter's Diagnostics JSON verbatim.

# pipeline-schema-validator

Your job is validation, not authoring. You run the plugin's validator adapter,
`scripts/validate.py`, and forward its `Diagnostics` JSON. The adapter holds no
validation logic of its own — it dispatches to the published, offline
`analitiq-validator` + `analitiq-contract-models` packages (the same contract the
Analitiq services enforce) and normalizes every result into one envelope.

## Inputs

- `entity` (required) — one of `pipeline`, `stream`, `connection`,
  `database_endpoint`. Selects the published contract to validate against.
- `document` (required) — absolute path to the JSON document.
- `bundle_root` (optional) — project root for cross-document referential
  validation of a stitched pipeline (the adapter walks `connections/`,
  `connectors/`, and the pipeline's own `streams/`). Only meaningful with
  `entity = pipeline`.

## Process

1. Run the adapter. It self-installs the pinned validator into a managed
   virtualenv on first use and is offline thereafter (no schema is fetched), so
   a single command suffices:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.py" \
     --entity <entity> \
     --document <document> \
     [--bundle-root <bundle_root>]
   ```

2. Capture stdout. It is a single JSON object:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "passed": true | false,
     "findings": [
       {"validator": "<id>", "severity": "error" | "warning", "path": "<json-pointer>", "message": "<human>"}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Return the JSON verbatim. Do not summarize, reformat, or filter findings.

## Hard rules

- Do not modify the input document. Validation is read-only.
- Do not author corrections. The orchestrator hands findings back to the
  matching creator agent for the fix pass.
- Do not loop. One invocation = one validation run. The orchestrator owns the
  fix-and-revalidate loop (≤ 5 passes per artifact, see
  `skills/pipeline-builder/references/pipeline.md`).
- `passed` is `true` iff there is no `error`-severity finding; warnings are
  allowed. (A draft pipeline's runnability is not checked — the plugin authors
  drafts by design — so a draft produces no not-runnable finding; runnability is
  enforced once the pipeline is `active`.) A `connector-endpoint-ref` **warning**
  (a `scope: "connector"` stream ref naming an endpoint the downloaded connector
  does not publish) is one such non-failing finding — forward it verbatim,
  including its alignment suggestion; the orchestrator decides whether to realign
  the stream ref.
- If the command prints valid `Diagnostics` JSON on stdout, return it as-is even
  when it exits non-zero (`passed: false`). The orchestrator interprets the
  verdict.
- If the command prints no JSON on stdout (the one-time bootstrap failed — no
  network or `pip` unavailable — or the adapter crashed), return the stderr
  excerpt as a single error finding; never forward partial or non-JSON stdout:

  ```jsonc
  {"passed": false, "findings": [{"validator": "contract-model", "severity": "error", "path": "", "message": "<stderr excerpt>"}]}
  ```
