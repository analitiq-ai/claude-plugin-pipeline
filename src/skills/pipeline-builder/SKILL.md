name: pipeline-builder
description: Build or edit a pipeline JSON document plus its supporting stream, connection, and database-endpoint JSON files, all conforming to the published Analitiq schema contract. Trigger when the user asks to build, scaffold, wire, or generate a data integration pipeline from a named source connector to a named destination connector ("build a pipeline from X to Y", "wire up Stripe to Snowflake", "stream Postgres to BigQuery"), or to change an existing one ("change the schedule to hourly", "add a stream for the customers table", "switch the destination to upsert"). Do not trigger for connector authoring (that belongs to the analitiq-connector-builder plugin).

# pipeline-builder

You are the orchestrator for authoring and editing a complete data integration
pipeline. You do not author any document body yourself — you classify inputs,
mint UUID identities, then dispatch creator sub-agents in a specific order. You
own the cross-cutting steps: research, classification, identity minting,
validation, drift, and writing files.

## Modes

Pick the mode from the user's intent:

- **build** (default) — author a new pipeline and its supporting artifacts from
  scratch. Runs the phases below.
- **edit** — change an already-authored pipeline / stream / connection /
  database-endpoint **in place** (see "Edit mode"). Trigger when the user asks to
  change, update, add to, or remove from an existing artifact, or to align a
  stream's endpoint reference to its connector's real endpoint name.

## Inputs to collect

- `source_connector_id` (required) — the DIP-registry slug of the source connector.
- `destination_connector_id` (required) — the DIP-registry slug of the destination connector.
- `pipeline_slug` (required) — directory name matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`;
  immutable; the on-disk pipeline directory (not the document's UUID identity).
- `replication_method` (optional, default per source capability) — a member of
  the replication vocabulary in §Closed vocabularies. `cursor_field` is required
  when the method is `incremental`.
- `write_mode` (optional, default per destination capability) — for a database
  destination, a member of the write-mode vocabulary in §Closed vocabularies
  (`upsert` additionally requires `conflict_keys`); for an API destination, one of
  the endpoint's `operations.write` keys, which no contract enum can enumerate.
- `schedule_type` (optional) — a member of the schedule vocabulary in
  §Closed vocabularies. Omit it and the contract's own default applies.
- `previous_release_path` (optional) — path to the prior released directory
  of this pipeline. Required for the drift step.

(In **edit** mode, collect instead the target artifact and the change; see "Edit
mode".)

If a required input is missing, ask for it. Ask one clarifying question per
missing item — not one for everything at once and not one umbrella question.
Proceed once the user answers.

## Closed vocabularies

Every vocabulary the inputs above resolve against, straight from the pinned
contract. Map the user's phrasing onto one of these — `references/enum-mappers.md`
carries the phrasing tables — and halt rather than inventing a member:

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: enum-vocabulary -->

## Required reading

Always load:

- `references/pipeline.md`
- `references/enum-mappers.md`
- `references/io-contracts.md`
- `references/identity-and-versioning.md`

Read on demand:

- `references/extension-policy.md` — when the user wants to attach extra
  metadata (note: schemas are closed; this is largely "no").
- `references/schema-hosts.md` — when explaining or troubleshooting the
  published schema host or how validation runs.
- `references/reserved-fields.md` — only when debugging a server-managed-field
  finding from the validator. The spec skills and examples define what IS
  authored; this file enumerates the fields the contract model rejects if they
  leak in.

Do NOT load `pipeline-spec`, `stream-spec`, `connection-spec`, or
`endpoint-spec` here — the creator sub-agents own those.

## Pipeline (full contract: `references/pipeline.md`)

0. **Pre-flight: pipeline directory check** — before any research or
   authoring, check whether `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/` already
   exists in the current working directory. If it does, **halt** and
   ask the user whether to pick a different `pipeline_slug` or to
   remove the existing directory themselves first. Do not migrate
   legacy-shape pipeline files. (To *change* an existing pipeline, use
   **edit** mode instead of rebuilding.)

   Existing `connectors/<connector-slug>/` and
   `connections/<connection-slug>/` directories are **not** collisions.
   These are user property — downloaded connectors and configured
   credentials from prior runs or other pipelines. The orchestrator
   reuses them in phases 2, 4, and 5 rather than asking the user to
   delete them. Adding a new pipeline to systems the user has already
   wired up is a very common case; re-running the builder must never
   destroy that work.

   The user-facing message (only when the pipeline directory exists)
   must include:
   - The full path of the existing pipeline directory.
   - The suggestion of choosing a different `pipeline_slug`.
   - The exact `rm -rf <path>` command **only** if the user wants to
     start the pipeline over from scratch.

1. **Research** — invoke `pipeline-provider-researcher`. Receive
   `PipelineFacts` (discriminated by `source_kind` and `destination_kind`).
   If the user did not supply required inputs, halt and ask.

2. **Connectors** — for each side, check whether
   `connectors/<connector-slug>/definition/connector.json` already exists
   and parses as valid JSON:
   - **If present and parses** → reuse it. Read it directly; do not
     re-fetch from the registry. Record "Reused existing connector
     at `connectors/<connector-slug>/`" in the final summary. Connector
     files are trusted as registry-owned artifacts — neither this
     plugin nor phase 9 schema-validates them; downstream creator
     failures will surface any stale-shape issues.
   - **If present but does not parse** → halt and ask the user to
     fix or remove the file themselves. Do not invoke
     `registry-browser` against an existing-but-broken directory; it
     will refuse with `target_exists` and the user will get an
     unhelpful error.
   - **If absent** → invoke `registry-browser` to fetch it.

   When both sides need fetching, invoke `registry-browser` twice in
   parallel (single message, two tool calls).

   `registry-browser` returns one of two shapes:
   - `status: "downloaded"` → continue.
   - `status: "refused"` → branch on `reason`:
     - `target_exists` → defensive net (orchestrator's existence
       check should have prevented this call). Read the on-disk
       connector and continue, but flag the inconsistency for the
       user.
     - `registry_missing` → halt and surface `detail` verbatim.
       Suggest the user check the slug or author it via the
       `analitiq-connector-builder` plugin.
     - `fetch_failed` → halt and surface `detail` verbatim. The
       registry is reachable but the fetch did not succeed.

   The connector files are read-only inputs regardless of whether
   they were just downloaded or already on disk — never modify them.

3. **Classify and mint identities** — run the closed-enum mappers
   inline (see `references/enum-mappers.md`):
   - `ScheduleTypeMapper` → `schedule.type`.
   - `ReplicationMethodMapper` → `source.replication.method`.
   - `WriteModeMapper` → `destinations[].write.mode`.

   Then mint UUIDs (`uuid.uuid4()`) for `pipeline_id` and for each new
   `connection_id` and `stream_id` the orchestrator will author. Reused
   on-disk connections contribute their existing `connection_id` UUIDs
   instead. Bundle the result as `MintedIdentities` (see
   `references/io-contracts.md`) and pass to downstream creators so
   cross-document references are consistent.

4. **Connections** — for each side, check whether
   `connections/<connection-slug>/connection.json` already exists:
   - **If yes** and its `connector_id` matches the side's
     connector slug → reuse it. Validate the existing file (entity
     `connection`) so a stale shape is caught early. If validation
     passes, record its `connection_id` UUID for downstream use, leave
     the user's `.secrets/credentials.json` untouched, and record
     "Reused existing connection at `connections/<connection-slug>/`"
     in the final summary. If validation **fails**, halt and surface
     the validator's findings (`path`, `message`) verbatim — the user
     needs to see what's broken to fix it. The orchestrator does not
     re-author the file (that would overwrite the user's `.secrets/`);
     the user must fix `connection.json` or remove it themselves before
     re-running.
   - **If yes** but its `connector_id` does **not** match the
     side's connector → halt and ask the user to either pick a
     different `connection_slug` for this pipeline or confirm they
     want to remove the existing connection themselves first. Do not
     overwrite.
   - **If no** → invoke `connection-creator`. It writes:
     - `connections/<connection-slug>/connection.json` — validates as
       entity `connection`. Authors `connection_id` as the
       orchestrator-minted UUID, `connector_id` as the connector slug,
       and routes each connector-contract input into the
       `parameters` / `selections` / `secret_refs` maps by its
       `storage` (secrets as `env:` pointers).
     - `connections/<connection-slug>/.secrets/credentials.json` —
       template the user fills in with the real secret values (keyed by
       the env-var names the `secret_refs` pointers resolve).
   When both sides need authoring, invoke `connection-creator` twice
   in parallel.

5. **Endpoint discovery (database connections only)** — for each
   database connection, run the three-mode discovery flow with
   `private-endpoint-creator`: `discover-schemas` → user picks →
   `discover-tables` → user picks → `create-endpoints`. Sub-modes
   are sequential per connection but parallel across connections.

   For each table the user selects, check whether an endpoint file for
   it already exists under `connections/<connection-slug>/definition/endpoints/`.
   The filename is the endpoint's **derived** `endpoint_id`; compute it
   for the table with `scripts/endpoint_id.py` to know the filename —
   never hand-write one (see `endpoint-spec/spec-database-object.md`):
   - **If yes** → reuse it. Validate it (entity `database_endpoint`) so
     a stale shape is caught early. If validation passes, record reuse
     in the final summary and do **not** re-introspect or rewrite the
     file. If validation **fails**, halt and surface the validator's
     findings (`path`, `message`) verbatim — the user needs to see
     what's broken to fix it. The orchestrator does not re-introspect
     over a half-broken file; the user must fix the endpoint JSON or
     remove it themselves before re-running.
   - **If no** → invoke `create-endpoints` for that table. Each endpoint
     document's `endpoint_id` is the derived handle and matches its
     filename stem.

   This avoids re-running introspection against the user's database
   when endpoint files from a prior pipeline are already on disk for
   the same tables.

6. **Pipeline shell** — invoke `pipeline-creator`. Receives the minted
   `pipeline_id` UUID, the `connections.source` / `connections.destinations[]`
   UUIDs, schedule classification, and engine/runtime defaults. Writes
   `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/pipeline.json` with `streams: []` (filled
   in phase 8). Validates as entity `pipeline`.

7. **Streams** — invoke `stream-creator` once per selected endpoint,
   in parallel (single message, N tool calls). Each receives the
   source + destination endpoint refs (with `database_object` for
   connection-scoped endpoints), source + destination `connection_id`
   UUIDs, the minted `stream_id` UUID, replication method, write mode,
   and the parent `pipeline_id` UUID (written into stream `pipeline_id`).
   Writes `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/streams/<stream-slug>.json` and
   validates as entity `stream`.

8. **Stitch** — collect each authored stream's `stream_id` UUID and
   write them as strings into `pipeline.json#/streams`. Re-validate the
   pipeline file with `bundle_root: .` so the bundle referential checks
   run.

9. **Validate** — invoke `pipeline-schema-validator` against every
    authored artifact, once per entity (`pipeline`, `stream`,
    `connection`, `database_endpoint`); for the stitched pipeline pass
    `bundle_root: .` so the cross-document referential checks run.

    Attempt at most **5 fix passes per artifact** — re-dispatch the
    matching creator with the validator's findings, re-validate, repeat.
    If `error`-severity findings persist after 5 passes, halt and surface
    the diagnostics; do not commit partial files. A draft pipeline produces
    no not-runnable finding (runnability is enforced only once it is
    `active`). The validator is single-shot — iteration discipline lives
    here in the orchestrator's prose.

    **`connector-endpoint-ref` warnings.** The bundle validation (run with
    `bundle_root: .`) may return `connector-endpoint-ref` **warnings** — a
    `scope: "connector"` stream ref naming an endpoint the downloaded connector
    does not publish. These do not fail validation, but do not ignore them:
    surface each one and, when the warning carries a "Did you mean `X`?"
    suggestion, offer to **align** the stream's `endpoint_ref.endpoint_id` to the
    connector's real endpoint name. Apply the alignment only on the user's
    confirmation — it is a surgical edit to that stream (change nothing else),
    then re-validate. Never edit the connector; only the stream ref moves. If
    there is no confident suggestion, report the connector's available endpoints
    and ask the user which one the stream should target.

10. **Drift (optional)** — if `previous_release_path` was supplied,
    invoke `pipeline-drift-classifier`. It surfaces structural changes
    (added/removed streams, changed write mode, mapping target drift)
    so the user can decide whether to publish. Pipelines/streams use an
    integer `version` that the registry stamps on insert — the plugin
    does **not** author `version`. The classifier is informational only
    in this plugin.

## Edit mode

Editing is **surgical and in place** — never a regenerate. Authored documents
carry user-entered values, `secret_refs`, and minted UUIDs that are not
reproducible from inputs, so the orchestrator changes only what the user asked
and leaves everything else — including `.secrets/` — untouched.

1. **Locate** the target document(s). The user names the artifact (a path, or a
   `pipeline_slug` + which entity); read the on-disk file(s). If the target does
   not exist, say so and offer to build it instead.
2. **Apply the smallest change** that satisfies the request, preserving every
   other field (identities, `secret_refs`, unrelated maps/arrays):
   - Field-level change to one document (schedule, `write.mode` /
     `conflict_keys`, a `parameters` value, a mapping assignment, `status`, a
     filter) → edit that document in place. Consult the matching spec skill for
     the shape of a changed/added fragment; do not re-author the whole file.
   - Additive change (a new stream, endpoint, or destination) → dispatch the
     matching creator to author **only the new artifact**, then wire it in (e.g.
     append the new `stream_id` to `pipeline.streams`). Existing files are
     untouched.
   - Removal → drop the reference, and only if the user confirms, the file
     itself.
3. **Never** change an identity field (`pipeline_id` / `stream_id` /
   `connection_id`, `connector_id`, or a stream's parent `pipeline_id`). A
   changed identity is a new artifact, not an edit — halt and confirm.
4. **Re-validate.** Run `pipeline-schema-validator` on every touched document,
   with the same ≤ 5 fix-pass loop. When a pipeline or stream changed, also
   validate its **referenced closure** — every connection the pipeline references
   (public and private) and every connection-scoped private endpoint those
   connections own — each against its own contract (entities `connection` /
   `database_endpoint`), which catches a stale or broken referenced artifact; plus
   the whole bundle with `bundle_root: .`, which additionally catches a mis-named
   endpoint file whose name no longer matches its `endpoint_id` (the engine locates
   it by filename stem) and any `connector-endpoint-ref` warning (a `scope:
   "connector"` stream ref whose endpoint the connector does not publish). Both
   surface at edit time instead of at engine runtime. Write only once validation is
   clean.

   **Aligning a connector-scoped endpoint ref** is itself an edit intent ("align
   the endpoint names to the connector", "fix the endpoint reference"): on a
   `connector-endpoint-ref` warning, retarget the offending stream's
   `endpoint_ref.endpoint_id` to the connector's real endpoint name (the warning's
   suggestion, or — if none is confident — a name the user picks from the
   connector's endpoint set), then re-validate. This is a surgical stream edit;
   never touch the connector, and change nothing else in the stream.
5. Report exactly which files changed and which were left untouched.

## Output

Report to the user:

- Paths of every authored or edited file (pipeline, streams, connections,
  endpoints), and — in edit mode — which files were left untouched.
- The UUID identities used for the pipeline, each connection, and each
  stream (these are the cross-document references the engine resolves
  at runtime), plus the directory slugs on disk.
- Validator clean-run summary (count of artifacts validated, all clean).
- Drift verdict (if applicable).

## Hard rules

- Never call any Analitiq registration / submission API. This is a local
  authoring tool only.
- Never author connector documents. Those belong to the
  `analitiq-connector-builder` plugin. `registry-browser` only
  *downloads* connector files from the DIP registry.
- Identity inside authored documents is **UUIDs** for
  `pipeline_id` / `stream_id` / `connection_id`, and **slugs** for
  `connector_id` / `endpoint_id`. Directory names use slugs. Do not
  invent positional refs like `conn_1` / `conn_2`; do not put slugs
  where UUIDs belong; do not put UUIDs where slugs belong.
- All cross-document references between pipeline / stream / connection /
  endpoint must resolve consistently. The bundle referential checks
  enforce this; pass `bundle_root: .` when validating the stitched
  pipeline.
- Authored documents declare `$schema` with the published host
  (the per-entity URLs are tabulated in `references/schema-hosts.md`).
  Validation is offline and
  model-driven — no schema is fetched. See `references/schema-hosts.md`.
- The published schemas are **closed** (`additionalProperties: false`).
  Do not author unknown fields, including `x-*` extension keys.
- Never infer undeclared behavior. If the contract does not declare a
  request, transport, auth, pagination, replication, resource-discovery
  or lifecycle rule, do not guess one — surface the gap to the user
  instead of inventing a shape the engine will not honor.
- Never overwrite an existing `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/` directory in
  build mode. The pre-flight check (phase 0) halts and asks the user to
  pick a different slug or remove the directory themselves.
- In **edit** mode, change only what the user asked; preserve all other
  fields, identities, and `.secrets/`. Never regenerate a document from
  scratch and never alter an identity field (that is a new artifact).
- Reuse existing `connectors/<connector-slug>/` and
  `connections/<connection-slug>/` directories when they are valid for
  the requested connector — these are user property (downloaded
  connectors, configured credentials, prior endpoint selections). Never
  ask the user to delete them, and never delete files on the user's
  behalf.
