# Orchestration pipeline (full contract)

This file is the long-form contract referenced by `SKILL.md §Pipeline`.
The orchestrator runs 10 phases in order. Each phase declares its
preconditions, the agent invoked (if any), and the postconditions that
the next phase relies on.

| # | Phase | Agent | Postcondition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Pre-flight pipeline-directory check | _orchestrator_ | `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/` does not exist on disk. Existing `connectors/` and `connections/` directories are reused, not blocked. |
| 1 | Research | `pipeline-provider-researcher` | A `PipelineFacts` JSON object is captured (see `io-contracts.md`). |
| 2 | Connector download or reuse | `registry-browser` × {0,1,2} (parallel per missing side) | `connectors/<connector-slug>/` exists for each side with `definition/connector.json` + (api only) `definition/endpoints/`. Sides already on disk are reused as-is. |
| 3 | Classify | _orchestrator_ | `schedule.type`, `replication.method`, `write.mode` resolved against closed enums. UUIDs minted for `pipeline_id` and each `connection_id` and `stream_id` the orchestrator will author. |
| 4 | Connections (author or reuse) | `connection-creator` × {0,1,2} (parallel per side missing on disk) | One `connections/<connection-slug>/connection.json` plus `connections/<connection-slug>/.secrets/credentials.json` per side, each validating against `connection/latest.json`. Sides already present (with matching `connector_id`) are reused, including their existing `.secrets/`. |
| 5 | Endpoint discovery | `private-endpoint-creator` × M (DB only, parallel across connections) | `connections/<connection-slug>/definition/endpoints/*.json` for selected tables, each validating against `database-endpoint/latest.json`. Endpoint files already on disk for the chosen tables are reused; only new tables run introspection. |
| 6 | Pipeline shell | `pipeline-creator` | `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/pipeline.json` with `streams: []`, validating against `pipeline/latest.json`. |
| 7 | Streams | `stream-creator` × K (parallel) | `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/streams/<stream-slug>.json` per selected endpoint, each validating against `stream/latest.json`. |
| 8 | Stitch | _orchestrator_ | `pipeline.json#/streams` is populated with the K `stream_id` UUIDs; bundle validates with `--bundle-root .`. |
| 9 | Validate | `pipeline-schema-validator` (looped, ≤ 5 passes) | Every artifact has zero `error`-severity findings. |
| 10 | Drift (optional) | `pipeline-drift-classifier` | A structural diff vs. `previous_release_path`; informational only. |

## Halt conditions

The orchestrator must halt (and surface a clear message) when:

- Phase 0 finds an existing `pipelines/<pipeline-slug>/` directory.
  (Existing `connectors/` and `connections/` directories are reused,
  not blocked.)
- Phase 1's required inputs are missing (`source_connector_id`,
  `destination_connector_id`, `pipeline_slug`).
- Phase 2 finds an on-disk `connectors/<connector-slug>/definition/connector.json`
  that fails to parse as JSON. The user is asked to fix or remove
  the file themselves.
- Phase 2's `registry-browser` returns `status: "refused"` with
  `reason ∈ {registry_missing, fetch_failed}`. The orchestrator
  surfaces `detail` verbatim to the user. (`target_exists` is **not**
  a halt — the orchestrator's existence check should have prevented
  the call; if it fires anyway, read the on-disk connector and flag
  the inconsistency. See SKILL.md phase 2 for the non-halting
  branch.)
- Phase 3's enum mappers fail to map an input (the user supplied
  something outside the closed set).
- Phase 4 finds an existing `connections/<connection-slug>/connection.json` whose
  `connector_id` does not match the side's connector slug. The user is
  asked to pick a different `connection-slug` or remove the existing
  file themselves.
- Phase 4's reuse-validation of an existing `connection.json` against
  `connection/latest.json` fails. The orchestrator surfaces the
  validator's findings (`validator`, `path`, `message`) verbatim and
  asks the user to fix or remove the existing file. The orchestrator
  does not overwrite user-owned connection files (including
  `.secrets/`).
- Phase 4's `connection-creator` returns a structured refusal (e.g.
  unsupported auth type for the chosen connector).
- Phase 5's database introspection fails (credentials wrong, network
  unreachable). The orchestrator surfaces the underlying error verbatim
  and waits for the user to fix it.
- Phase 5's reuse-validation of an existing endpoint file against
  `database-endpoint/latest.json` fails. The orchestrator surfaces
  the validator's findings (`validator`, `path`, `message`) verbatim
  and asks the user to fix or remove the file; introspection is not
  rerun against a half-broken file.
- Phase 9 still has `error`-severity findings after 5 fix passes.

Halting means: do not write partial files, do not advance to a later
phase, and do not auto-retry without user input.

## Parallel dispatch

Phases that dispatch multiple agents in parallel (2, 4, 7) issue all
calls in a single message — multiple tool invocations in one turn — so
they run concurrently. Do not sequence them artificially.

## Identity minting (phase 3)

The orchestrator generates RFC-4122 UUIDs for `pipeline_id`,
`connection_id` (one per side), and `stream_id` (one per selected
endpoint) and threads them through the creator agents so cross-document
references are consistent. Reused on-disk connections contribute their
existing `connection_id` UUIDs instead.

## Fix-and-revalidate loop (phase 9)

For each artifact:

1. Run the validator.
2. If `passed: true`, accept and move on.
3. If `passed: false`, collect the findings and re-invoke the matching
   creator with the findings attached, asking it to fix exactly the
   reported errors (and only those — no opportunistic edits).
4. Re-validate. Increment the pass counter.
5. Stop after 5 passes regardless of state. If still failing, halt and
   surface the diagnostics.

The validator is stateless — pass count and discipline live here, not
in `scripts/validate.py`.
