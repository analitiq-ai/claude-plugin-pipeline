# connection-spec

This skill is loaded by `connection-creator` when authoring a connection
document: one user's configured **instance** of a connector.

## Required reading (load on demand)

- `spec-envelope.md` — the four author-time maps
  (`parameters`/`selections`/`discovered`/`secret_refs`), the storage-driven
  routing rule, and the `env:` secret-pointer + `.secrets/` template workflow.
- The closest `examples/*.example.json` for the connector's `auth.type` (shape
  guidance only; the connector contract's `storage` is authoritative for
  routing, so the example set never needs to grow when a new connector ships).

## What this skill covers

A connection owns exactly this much, and nothing else:

- user-entered non-secret values;
- user-selected post-auth values that must persist;
- provider-discovered post-auth values (server-managed);
- secret references;
- auth lifecycle metadata (server-managed);
- connection-level private endpoints, discovery artifacts, and
  connection-scoped type maps.

Plus the two authoring jobs those imply: routing each `connection_contract`
input / post-auth output into its map by the last segment of its declared
`storage` (see `spec-envelope.md`), and scaffolding `secret_refs` as `env:`
pointers with the matching `.secrets/credentials.json` template.

Only what the field table below declares is authorable here. The server-managed
parts of that list (`discovered`, auth lifecycle metadata) belong to the
service, and the endpoint / discovery / type-map artifacts are separate
documents that merely hang off this connection.

## What this skill does NOT cover

- The connector's `connection_contract` itself — that lives in the connector
  document, authored by the `analitiq-connector-builder` plugin. A connection is
  an *instance* of a connector, never a second copy of it: never restate a
  connector-owned request template, transport rule, auth flow, pagination rule
  or provider quirk inside a connection. If a value is the same for every user
  of the connector, it belongs to the connector.
- Endpoint discovery — see `endpoint-spec`.

## Draft connections, and what a clean validation does not prove

A connection may be saved as a **draft** with its activation requirements unmet
— a secret not yet provisioned, a post-auth step not yet run. It becomes active
only once everything the contract marks `required_for_activation` resolves.
Author the honest draft; never invent a placeholder value to force a connection
into looking activatable. Draft-vs-active is service-side state, not something
this document carries — the field table declares no connection `status`, so
there is nothing to author either way.

Provider reachability is out of scope for connection validation: the validator
never contacts the provider. A connection with zero findings can still fail at
runtime on credentials, network, permissions or a missing resource. Report it as
structurally valid, never as "working" or "tested".

## Output rules

Every authored document must:

1. Declare `$schema` with the connection URL from the table below.
2. Author `connector_id` (the connector slug being instantiated; required).
   `connection_id` is an RFC-4122 UUID — author one the plugin generates, or
   omit it and let the service assign one on ingest.
3. Route every contract input/output into `parameters` / `selections` /
   `secret_refs` by its `storage` (never author `discovered` — it is
   server-managed). For each `storage: "secrets"` key, write an `env:` pointer
   into `secret_refs` and add the env-var name to `.secrets/credentials.json`.
4. Pass the validator (`pipeline-schema-validator`, entity `connection`) with
   zero error findings.
