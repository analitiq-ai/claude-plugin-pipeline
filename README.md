# Analitiq Pipeline Builder Plugin

A Claude Code plugin for **creating and editing data pipelines and streams**
between [Analitiq DIP](https://github.com/orgs/analitiq-dip-registry/repositories)
connectors. Describe a source and a destination in plain language; the plugin
downloads the connectors from the registry, interviews you for the details, and
authors validated **pipeline**, **stream**, **connection**, and
**database-endpoint** JSON documents against the published schema contract at
[`schemas.analitiq.ai`](https://schemas.analitiq.ai).

It is a **local authoring tool**: it never creates connectors — that's the
[connector-creator plugin](https://github.com/analitiq-ai/claude-plugin-connector) —
and it calls no registration APIs. It only writes JSON to disk for you to review
and submit.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin add ./claude-plugin-pipeline/src
```

## Use

Launch Claude Code in your project and describe the pipeline you want:

> build a pipeline from Stripe to Snowflake

The plugin then:

1. **Interviews you** — replication method, write mode, schedule, naming.
2. **Downloads** the source and destination connectors from the DIP registry
   (read-only; reused if already on disk).
3. **Authors** a connection per side (with a `.secrets/credentials.json`
   template you fill in), the endpoint documents, the pipeline shell, and one
   stream per endpoint.
4. **Validates** every artifact against the published contract (the offline
   `analitiq-validator` package), including cross-document referential checks.
5. **Writes files** to disk — only once everything passes.

You can also **edit** an existing pipeline in place — e.g. "change the schedule
to hourly" or "add a stream for the customers table". The plugin changes only
what you ask and re-validates; it never regenerates or overwrites your secrets.

Output lands under `connections/`, `pipelines/`, and (read-only) `connectors/`.
Fill in the `.secrets/` templates, then submit the connections and pipeline to
the registry. The full file layout, identity model, and secrets workflow are
documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Validate manually

Validation runs the published, offline `analitiq-validator` package through a
thin adapter (the plugin self-installs it on first use):

```bash
python3 src/scripts/validate.py \
  --entity pipeline \
  --document path/to/pipeline.json \
  --bundle-root path/to/project
```

Output is a single `Diagnostics` JSON object; exit `0` iff `passed: true`. Tests
live under `tests/` — run with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`.
How validation dispatches per entity is documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## How it fits together

This plugin **wires connectors into pipelines** — it does not build the
connectors themselves.

| | Repository | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **This plugin** | [claude-plugin-pipeline](https://github.com/analitiq-ai/claude-plugin-pipeline) | Authors pipelines, streams, connections, and endpoints. |
| Connectors | [analitiq-dip-registry](https://github.com/orgs/analitiq-dip-registry/repositories) | One repository per connector; downloaded read-only. |
| Connector-creator | [claude-plugin-connector](https://github.com/analitiq-ai/claude-plugin-connector) | Authors the connectors this plugin consumes. |
| Schemas | [schemas.analitiq.ai](https://schemas.analitiq.ai) | The published JSON Schema contract everything validates against. |
