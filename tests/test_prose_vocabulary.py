"""Gate the prose *outside* generated blocks (issue #24).

`test_generated_blocks_in_sync` verifies the contents of every marked region.
Nothing verified a fact was **in** a region — delete a marker pair, hand-type a
wrong vocabulary in its place, and the suite stayed green.

Two checks close that, and it is worth being precise about which does the work:

1. `test_docs_carry_their_required_blocks` — the load-bearing one. Every doc must
   still carry the blocks it is supposed to carry. Deleting a block from a doc is
   the actual #24 scenario, and no content heuristic can catch it reliably,
   because what replaces the block is by definition wrong in an unpredictable
   way. Pinning the manifest catches it regardless of what the replacement says.

2. `test_no_undeclared_vocabulary_restatement` — the heuristic. It finds a doc
   that names a whole closed vocabulary outside a block, which must then be
   declared in ALLOWED_RESTATEMENTS with a reason and its exact expected member
   set. It catches a *correct* copy appearing somewhere new, and — because the
   declared set is asserted exactly — any later drift inside a copy we tolerate.

Why the manifest is primary. The heuristic is a full-set match, so it is blind to
drift by *omission or rename*: a hand-typed table missing a member is not a
superset and does not match. Loosening it to "names >= 2 members" would fire on
ordinary guidance that contrasts two members, which this prose does constantly.
So the heuristic cannot be the gate for the headline case, and is not asked to be.

Detection limits of the heuristic, stated so nobody over-trusts it:
  * members must appear in backticks. Dropping that is not an option — members
    include `in`, `range`, `pattern`, `required`, `fail` and `skip`, ordinary
    words that saturate this prose.
  * a restatement inside a fenced code block using bare (unticked) members is not
    seen. `FENCED_RESTATEMENTS` records the ones that exist today.
  * scope is `*.md` under `src/`.
  * `_sections()` does not track fenced blocks, so a column-0 `#` inside a fence
    would split a section early. Zero occurrences across the 39 fences in `src/`
    today; the failure mode is a missed detection, never a false one.
