"""Tests for the contract-doc generator (src/scripts/gen_contract_docs.py).

The prose under `src/` is the only prose Analitiq still keeps, so the facts it
states about the contract are generated from the pinned published package rather
than typed by hand. The load-bearing test here is `test_generated_blocks_in_sync`:
it is the drift gate. If a pin bump changes an enum, a regex, a bound, or an
advisory rule, that test fails until the docs are regenerated.

Like the adapter tests, this module skips cleanly when the published packages are
absent so a bare `pytest` never fails confusingly.
